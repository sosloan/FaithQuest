# App Icon Placeholder

To complete the app icon setup:

1. Create or design a 1024x1024 PNG image for your app icon
2. Save it as `AppIcon-1024.png` in this directory
3. Xcode will automatically generate all the required sizes

## Design Suggestions

For FaithQuest, consider an icon that represents:
- The bridge between physical and intellectual
- Three realms (Locker Room, Library, Bridge)
- Balance and harmony
- The circular nature of the grand loop

## Colors

Consider using:
- Orange (Locker Room energy)
- Blue (Library wisdom)
- Purple (Bridge connection)

A gradient or circular design connecting these colors would fit the app's philosophy.
